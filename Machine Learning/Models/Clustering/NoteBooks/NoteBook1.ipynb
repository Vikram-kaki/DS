    "### What is Clustering?\n",
    "🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar objects or data points into clusters based on their characteristics or features. 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Clustering\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Hierarchical Clustering** 🏰\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering that builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting existing clusters. It can be further divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agglomerative Clustering** 🌈: This method starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges them into larger clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Agglomerative Clustering](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1674149819/Dendrogram_of_Agglomerative_Clustering_Approach_4eba3586ec.png) 🏰\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Divisive Clustering** ⚔️: This method starts with all data points in a single cluster and splits them into smaller clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **K-Means Clustering** 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is a method of clustering that partitions the data into K clusters based on their similarities. It is a popular and widely used clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![K-Means Clustering](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1678462092/image7_a1777d39aa.png) 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **DBSCAN Clustering** 📍\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a method of clustering that groups data points into clusters based on their density and proximity to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DBSCAN Clustering](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*tc8UF-h0nQqUfLC8-0uInQ.gif) 📍\n",

    "### Applications of Clustering\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Customer Segmentation** 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can be used to segment customers based on their demographics, behavior, and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Image Segmentation** 📸\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can be used to segment images into different regions based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Gene Expression Analysis** 🔬\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can be used to analyze gene expression data and identify patterns and relationships between genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Silhouette Coefficient** 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "The silhouette coefficient is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Calinski-Harabasz Index** 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calinski-Harabasz index is a measure of the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Davies-Bouldin Index** ⚔️\n",
    "\n",
    "The Davies-Bouldin index is a measure of the similarity between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **K-Means Algorithm** 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into K clusters based on their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm** 🏰\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical clustering algorithm builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting existing clusters.\n",
